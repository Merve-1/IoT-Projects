# IoT Projects üåê  

## Repository Overview  

Welcome to the **IoT Projects** repository! This repository contains various IoT projects I have worked on. Currently, it includes two projects:  

1. **Tracking of Pharmaceutical Products**: A system that tracks pharmaceutical products in cargo vehicles by collecting data such as humidity, temperature, and location. This data is sent via SMS to a receiving circuit at the company's end.  
2. **Secure Home**: A simulation for a smart home security system. Currently, it is a work-in-progress project that will feature AES encryption for secure data handling.  

## Projects  

### 1. **Tracking of Pharmaceutical Products**  

This system integrates sensors in cargo vehicles to monitor:
- **Humidity**  
- **Temperature**  
- **Location**  

The collected data is sent via SMS, which is then received and processed by a circuit at the company's end to ensure product integrity and security during transit.  

### 2. **Secure Home**  

A smart home simulation focusing on security. The project is still under development and will include:
- **AES Encryption** for secure communication and data handling.  
- Sensors for monitoring home security, environmental factors, and automation.  

## Technologies Used  

- **Arduino**: For interfacing with sensors and circuits.
- **AES Encryption**: For secure data handling (in development).  

## Getting Started  

### Prerequisites  

- üíª **Arduino IDE**  
- üîê **Cryptography Library** (for AES encryption, in development)  

## Future Developments  

Projects will expand to include more features and enhancements, such as automated alerts, advanced security mechanisms, and integration with IoT platforms.
